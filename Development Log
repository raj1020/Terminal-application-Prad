Status Update 1 (3 September 2019, 3 p.m.): I was  originally planning to write an application that would provide holiday destination 
recommendation to the users based on their activity of interest. However, after carefully considering all the factors, I decided that the 
application code would be too short and might lack many features of Ruby. After pondering upon what feature would  add most value to the 
application, I thought that providing further recommendations to the users based on the length of their potential holiday would be the 
best. To successfully add this new feature I had to cut a few features from the original application. The original application took 
multiple inputs from the users about the activities of their interest. Based on these activities the application could suggest one or 
more destinations. Retaining these features on the new application would significantly increase the need for information to make the 
application uptodate. Hence, the first part of the application was pared down to get only one input about user’s choice of activity and 
the application would suggest only one destination to the user. 
Status Update 2 (4 September 2019, 3:30 p.m.): When coding for the application was finished, I realised that there was no robust error 
handling mechanism in the application. After carefully considering all the options, I decided that the best way to address this challenge 
was to us a “begin-rescue-end” block in the method part of the code. If there was any error that prevented the execution of the method 
block, a message will be displayed to the users that would say try again later.
